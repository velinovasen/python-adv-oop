'''Phonebook
Write a program that receives info from the console about people and their phone numbers.
You are free to choose the way the data is entered; each entry should have a name and a number (both strings). If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, update its number.
After filling the phonebook, you will receive a number â€“ N. Your program should be able to perform a search of a contact by name and print her details in format "{name} -> {number}". In case the contact isn't found, print "Contact {name} does not exist."
